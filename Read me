Predictive Maintenance & Surface Defect Classification
This script performs two separate tasks using deep learning:

Predictive Maintenance

Uses an LSTM model on tabular time-series data to predict equipment failure.

Input: CSV file with sensor readings and failure labels.

Steel Surface Defect Classification

Uses a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of steel surface defects.

Input: NEU Metal Surface Defects dataset in a ZIP file.

Setup and Usage
Download the datasets:

Predictive Maintenance CSV:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiimanshuagarwal/predictive-maintenance-dataset

NEU Metal Surface Defects ZIP:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data

Place the files in the data directory:

data/predictive_maintenance.csv

data/neu_defects.zip

Run the script (updated_ml_pipeline.py) in a Python environment with TensorFlow installed.

The defects zip will be automatically extracted.

Training will start for both models if datasets are found.

Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

Optional: GPU for faster training

Output
Prints training metrics for predictive maintenance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

Prints test accuracy for surface defect classification.
 NOTE :- I did not add image path to code please add path to code while executing it.
